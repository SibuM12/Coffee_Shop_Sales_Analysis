Key Findings & Insights

Top-Selling Products:
o	Barista Espresso and Cappuccino generated the highest revenue across all store locations.

Underperforming Products:
o	Non-coffee items like Clothing and Houseware showed minimal sales and are not aligned with the coffee shop’s brand offering.

Peak Sales Hours:
o	The busiest periods were 7 AM – 9 AM and 12 PM – 2 PM, correlating with morning and lunch coffee rushes.

Slow Time Slots:
o	Sales dropped significantly after 4 PM, suggesting potential for late-afternoon promotions or discounts.

Revenue by Product Type:
o	Beverage sales accounted for over 70% of total revenue, followed by bakery and food items.

Store Location Insights:
o	The Downtown branch consistently outperformed other locations, indicating strong commuter traffic and repeat customers.

Recommendations
•	Marketing: Launch happy-hour or combo promotions during slow hours (after 4 PM).
•	Inventory: Stock more of top-performing items like Barista Espresso and Cappuccino.
•	Product Optimization: Reduce or discontinue low-performing categories (e.g., clothing, houseware).
•	Customer Engagement: Implement a loyalty program to encourage repeat purchases during peak hours.

Next Steps
•	Automate daily sales reporting using Snowflake + Excel Power Query.
•	Track sales across multiple locations in real-time dashboards.
•	Introduce monthly performance tracking to identify early dips in product demand.
